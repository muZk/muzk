# Hi 👋, I'm Nicolás

I'm a developer and entrepreneur interested in Healthtech, Marketing, and Privacy.

## Now

Usually, when people ask, _"so, what are you up to at the moment?"_ my mind goes blank. So I've put this [now page](https://nownownow.com/about):

- 💼 I'm working remotely as a Rails Programmer in _Health Carousel_, a company that provides temporary healthcare professionals to Hospitals and healthcare facilities.

- 🦕 With [Eli](https://github.com/EliAndrea) we founded Codeness, a software company that creates digital products for healthcare professionals. We made _Apposito_ (Firebase + React Native 😉), an application that helps nurses document wounds objectively (with images).

- 🤖 Launching "Elliot", a platform where you can invest in crypto mining without managing your own hardware. Powered by Ruby on Rails ♦️

- ⚛️ Working in a React Hooks course (in Spanish) for [EscuelaFrontend](https://escuelafrontend.com/).

- 🪶 Working on "Raven" (side project), a platform where you can create email courses in a breeze. Powered by Ruby on Rails ♦️

- ✍️ I also write. I have a monthly newsletter about Healthtech, and I would like to revive my blogs 😢

- Backend: Ruby on Rails, Node, Firebase
- Frontend: React, HTML, CSS (vanilla, Bootstrap, Tailwind), Hotwire
