# Hi 👋, I'm Nicolás

I'm a developer and entrepreneur interested in Healthtech, Marketing, and Privacy.

## Now

Usually, when people ask, _"so, what are you up to at the moment?"_ my mind goes blank. So I've put this [now page](https://nownownow.com/about):

- 💼 I'm working remotely as a Rails Programmer in _Health Carousel_. This company provides temporary healthcare professionals to Hospitals and healthcare facilities.

- 🦕 With [Eli](https://github.com/EliAndrea) we founded [Codeness](https://github.com/codeness-io), a software company that creates digital products for healthcare professionals. We made _Apposito_ (Firebase + React Native 😉), an application that helps nurses document wounds objectively (with images).

- 🎓 Teaching Frontend development with ⚛️ React in [Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile](https://www.uc.cl/).

- 🤖 Launching "Elliot", a platform where you can invest in crypto mining without managing your own hardware. Powered by Ruby on Rails ♦️

- ⚛️ Working in a React Hooks course (in Spanish) for [EscuelaFrontend](https://escuelafrontend.com/).
