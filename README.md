# Hi 👋, I'm Nicolás

[Product Engineer](https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/the-product-minded-engineer/) focused on Healthtech products.

## Now

Usually, when people ask, _"so, what are you up to now?"_ my mind goes blank. So I've put this [now page](https://nownownow.com/about):

- 🦕 With [Eli](https://github.com/EliAndrea), we founded [Codeness](https://github.com/codeness-io), a software company that creates digital products for healthcare professionals. We made [Apposito](https://apposito.codeness.io) (Firebase + React Native 😉), an application that helps nurses document wounds objectively (with images).

- 🎓 I'm teaching Frontend development with ⚛️ React in [Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile](https://www.uc.cl/) for the [Web Development Diploma](https://educacionprofesional.ing.uc.cl/?diplomado=diplomado-en-desarrollo-web).
